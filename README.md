## DESCRIPTION
Establishing a standardised approach for the measurement of neonatal noxious-evoked brain activity in response to an acute somatic nociceptive heel lance stimulus - scripts for figures and analysis.

These are the scripts used in the analysis of data for a study that was pre-registered as a protocol at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/ZY9MS. 

These scripts are used to (i) perform analyses for preregistered outcome neutral checks, and for hypotheses 1, 2 and 3; (ii) to perform an exploratory meta-analysis; and (iii) to generate the Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5 in the main manuscript. 

## DATA AVAILABILITY
Ethical conditions limit the sharing of the raw Exeter data publicly. Data requests should be made to the senior author (rebeccah.slater@paediatrics.ox.ac.uk). Data will be shared with investigators whose proposed use of the data has been approved by the senior author Professor Rebeccah Slater, to achieve aims in the approved proposal. Source data for the hypothesis tests and for Figs 3, 4 and 5 arising from the Exeter dataset are provided in this repository.
